                    Hey! My name is Niko Huber and I am a 20 year old software developer, vehicle enthusiast, and lover of digital creation. 
                    <br><br> Currently, I am a junior at the Rochester Institute of Technoloty studying New Media Interactive Development. (I am very used to having to explain the meaning of exactly what I do to everyone at family gathering that give the age old icebreaker of "what is your major"), so I can give the same description I have given to every parent: 
                    <br><br> Essentially, I specialize in User Interfaces and User Experiences and application development for scalable platforms. As well as for new mediums such as Virtual Reality and various other touch devices (smart watches and that touchscreen checkout kiosk at Costco). 
                    <br><br> Now that is just the major description, personally I have a deep passion for live production and performance. Throughout college I worked with RIT Tech Crew providing all the production services for on campus events, while also working and attending various other performances and festivals in the region and abroad. Some of my hobbies that stemmed off of that love include: live visual graphics, virtual world creation, lighting design, audio and lighting networking, photography / videography, and graphic design. 
                    <br><br> As I continue through university, I gain more experience, knowledge, and the ability to tackle projects. I created this website on a flight overseas to showcase my thoughts, ideas, and put myself out there. While this whole introduction makes this seem like a personal portfolio or resume, this is a corner of the internet dedicated to my thoughts, projects, and passions. As well as just a showcase of who I am as a person! 
                    <br><br> Please feel free to wander and poke through my thoughts. If you have any comments, suggestions, ideas, feel free ot reach out at nrh9757@rit.edu!

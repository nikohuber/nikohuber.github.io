                For one of our in class assignments, we messed around with using Unity as an active serial connection, and would send and return data from the UnityProject to the arduino.

                <br><br> This would result in the cube moving when the potentiometer is moved, and the red light turning on once the cube has moved past a certain threshold.

                <br><br> It was really fun to watch this come together and also watch a physical input have interactions within unity in realtime!

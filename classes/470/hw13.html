                For homework 13, we saw the introduction of third party libraries and community generated functions, as well as the concepts of capacitive sensors! There is a near library that was created for using arduino inputs as capacitive sensors- and allows you to turn on lights using just your body. 
                <br><br>This was such a great way to have an interactive connection and interaction with the circuit. While buttons and potentiometers are fun and a step above software, having the physical interaction and seeing a light change to my interaction was a very nice touch! I would love to integrate capacitive elements into other projects later on.

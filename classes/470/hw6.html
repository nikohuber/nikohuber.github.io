                For homework six we started to get into the usage of buzzers / small speakers to create sound and annoy my roommates and neighbors! By using a photoresistor to control the buzzer, we were able to activate the range for the photoresistor during a startup period, then moving further away from the photoresistor and closer to change the pitch of the buzzer. 
               
                <br><br>This homework was pretty simple, as the photoresistor was tied almost directly to the buzzer volume. The setup code was pretty fun, giving you a period of time to change the window for the buzzer reactivity. Also, hearing audible reactivity was a very interactive experience and just like the last homework, was a great way to get a better response to the code that was being created.

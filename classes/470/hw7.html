                For homework seven, we added more interactivity to the existing buzzer by having buttons control the input to switch between different notes on a virtual piano. However, all of the buttons were condensed onto one singular analog input. I had not thought of this before, as you can use different resistance resistors and specific wiring to use a singular analog input and parse the input between certain values to tell which button is being pressed. 
                <br><br>I was captivated by the condensation of button inputs into a singular analog input. It was a much more efficient way to use multiple control surfaces while only using one input. I will certainly be using this in future projects and interfaces to condense inputs.

                Babyâ€™s First Circuit:

                Chapter one starts to delve into the basics of circuitry with just a button, resistor, and LED. The booklet delves a bit deeper into the fundamentals of basic electronic components such as transducers like sensors and actuators, and touches on the lovely V = IR formula and its relevance. Continuity is incredibly important in electronics and is required for functionality. 
                <br><br>Once I got a bit more involved with the hardware things got a bit more hands on. I have always loved the layout of small electronic breadboards and just thinking about how I would want to line cables up so they would be efficient enough off of the main rails to not use a ton of wires. I have always found schematic views to be so confusing at first, but the more that I look at them, the more I start to understand their relevance especially when circuits get more complex. On basic breadboards, it is much easier to just look at the pinouts and pin placement on the board, but once you expand further from a singular breadboard, or have external sensors, wiring diagrams may be more helpful than breadboard top-down views. 
                <br><br>The basic button circuit was a very simple circuit! With just one main flow to worry about, not much could go wrong. After the simple singular button, we explored the effects of parallel buttons and series buttons: with both series buttons having to be pressed to get light, and only one parallel button needing to be pressed to get light.

                Homework 11 saw the reintroduction of importing libraries, and also the formal introduction of the liquid crystal display. By using a screen, we can display characters and write outputs with ease. The library makes everything so much easier when trying to parse input text and display it to the screen, as you can simply just “print” to the screen the same way you would to the console. This whole screen control system was a lot easier to integrate than I was expecting, and was definitely something I would consider throwing into future later projects for added interactivity.

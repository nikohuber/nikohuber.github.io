                Homeworks 4 saw the introduction of using pulse width modulation on digital outputs to simulate the effects of analog signals to control and RGB LED. Three photoresistors with gels were placed in analog inputs, and the resulting output was normalized and then sent to the individual inputs of the RGB LED, thus allowing for us to switch on or off sections of the LED by simply covering the corresponding photoresistor. 


                <br><br>This homework was very fun and saw the integration of analog and digital inputs and outputs. Usually, I was very used to using analog inputs and then using thresholds to send to digital outputs, but this was an entirely different way to use digital outputs with PWM. My breadboard did get a bit cramped with everything that was going on- but that was mostly due to using cables that were unnecessarily large for some portions of the build. I also could not find the blue gel for the life of me, and had to make due with that photoresistorâ€¦.

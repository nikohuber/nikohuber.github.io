                For homework eight we utilized a tilt-sensor to control a timed countdown using six red LEDs. The end result was a hourglass-like control surface where you could shake the breadboard to start the timer, and it would then count down in a hour and ultimately all the LEDs would light up red. Shaking the board during the countdown would then reset the counter and it would start all over again. 
                <br><br>Working with the millis() function for timing opened up a lot of new possibilities for scripting and having more interactive interfaces. Being able to actively interrupt the countdown was very fun too- I am starting to see a pattern of “those more interactive one of these examples gets, the more fun it is!”

            <h2>Background</h2>
            The goal of project 3 was to create some sort of an artistic experience. 

            <br><br>

            Building custom lighting fixtures has always been a dream of mine- and with the doors that have been opened in my head with arduinos and microcontrollers as a whole. The amount of libraries and dependencies that have been created for IOT devices and small microcontrollers is incredible! 

            <h2>What to Make?</h2>
            One of my favorite lighting fixtures is an LED tube light. I had always wanted one so badly when I started to get more into lighting. Well, to backtrack I was really into photography and videography for a while- and tube lights were almost a standard for wash lighting and as I started to learn more about stage lighting and programmed a few of my own shows, tube lights and pixel fixtures are incredibly neat! (and being used much more often in shows nowadays)
            <br><br>
            <h2>The Big Issue: Cost </h2>
            Most tubes are insanely expensive, upwards of hundreds of dollars. While the lumen output and color reproduction is likely incredible, I wanted to try and make one for significantly less. You can find tube light covers designed for protecting larger industrial tube lights, and theyre $3 and fairly well built! For diffusion, parchment paper works pretty well with LED strips and smaller led pixels. I folded the paper and fit in in the tube, and then added an argb led strip. I had tried this with a 12v rgb led strip and transistors, but found that it was much easier to use a 5v argb led stip and directly control the pixels with wled, an incredibly feature rich esp32 library for controlling LEDs!
            <br><br>
            
            <h2>Changing Direction</h2>
            The primary decision for using a 5v argb strip was so that I could natively use the WLED library for driving pixels rather than have to use a dedicated artnet decoder. This would also allow me to use SPI rather than just RGB control for the whole strip! Meaning I can have control over each pixel on the strip rather than just one fixed color for every pixel on the strip. 
            Perhaps the most important library I used was the <a href = “https://kno.wled.ge/”> WLED Library </a>. This allowed me to have control over various settings over a web server and also allowed me to wirelessly transmit artnet packets over wifi from resolume arena, or any other lighting software of my choice.

            <h2>What's Next</h2>
            I would like to build more of these, and I would also like to build a wired ethernet version that would be a lot more reliable in show conditions. Wifi is too unstable and packet loss is inevitable. Having a wired version would make operation much more efficient and simpler. I have a WT32-eth01 sitting around that would be perfect for this role. Or even with a different route, I could have a dmx decoder on each fixture that would convert dmx to spi, and could be more of a modular setup. I feel like there are many more directions that I could take this project to make it more of a standalone product that can be integrated into real-world show environments.

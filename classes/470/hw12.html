                For homework 12, we brought together a lot of the past homeworks for a culmination in the “knock lock.” This contraption is basically just a locking mechanism for a door or any closed container. There is a piezo which is just wired as an input or a microphone so you can then read the input signal that is generated by the coils of the magnet in the driver. That input signal is read so that if you knocked (made noise) a very certain way, the lock would open, and you could press a button to close the lock. 
                <br><br>There were some fun little methods that were snuck into the code for this one- The use of external functions (finally) was a great touch and being able to gauge the amount of knocks to open the door was neat! While it’s not exactly “knocks”, its more just noise and any noise of that same level would work- it was a very fun proof of concept!!!

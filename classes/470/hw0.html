                An introduction to Arduino:

                I have been relatively friendly with my arduino starter kit for the past six years, regularly pulling pieces for random electronics projects and shenanigans. Nonetheless, the setup process for the Arduino IDE is as simple as ever! Especially with the windows application on the app store. Furthermore- reading through the introductory booklet brings simple facts that I had either completely forgotten or never really learned with my older DIY approach, such as the proper terminology for diodes and the proper uses for capacitors! 
                <br><br>The first chapter is really just familiarizing yourself with the starter kit and learning all the parts that are in there! With my kit being a few years old, it is more like me familiarizing myself with what is left in my kit and what is currently missing. I already have the IDE installed on my home pc, so thankfully I did not have to go through some of the driver setup processes.

Overall, the setup of the circuit was pretty straightforward and did not need much explanation or second guessing from the book. The only thing that caught me off guard was the orientation of the button, which I had inverted and was completing my input circuit by accident.

With the incredibly tiny default window sizing and allâ€¦ I am very excited to delve into the more extensive projects which require more unique and individualized coding-

                    Before the spring of 2024 I was vaguely familiar with the processes behind interactive art exhibits. I have ventured to a few museums with projector installations and virtual reality exhibits, but rarely delved deep into the creation of interactive art exhibits besides building a visual mixer for vjing in touch designer. I saw the oppurtunity to join a team for a semester to create an interactive art exhibit for a local dj collective and had to take it! 

                    <br><br>

                    I had messed around with touch designer for a few months beforehand- following random youtube tutorials until I felt as if I had a strong enough basis to start some projects of my own. At the time, I didn't have resolume and wanted to work with a midi controller for real-time video mixing and manipulation. Over time, the complexity built up and it had a scripted bpm clock, countless bpm synced effects, and even some well needed optimization and filtering to preserve performance. I had then used this rig at a few shows locally and it worked a lot better than I thought! I had inadvertantly learned a lot about video routing, projection, and formatting throughout the process.

                    Heading into this team project, I felt incredibly prepared to tackle the technical challenges of creating an interactive experience. However, after finishing the experience, I realize I was not ready for one thing: clients. 

                    <br><br>

                    The basis of the exhibit was to create an interactive art exhibit that would coincide with a dj set from a local collective. That was all the direction we got for the project. As a group, we were tasked with creating a meaningful experience for attendees. Ultimately, we settled on breaking the core fundamentals of dance (an important part of the collective) into an expressive and a physical layer. The phyiscal aspect of dance was captured using a thermal camera, which was then manipulated in touch designer and then projected onto a translucent surface which allowed for participants to see a reflection of themselves on the box infront of them. The expressive layer was embodied with an xbox kinect that was then used to displace a particle simulation in touch designer.

                    <br><br>

                    As stated earlier, technical aspects of this project went quite smoothly. Routing was seamless and programs worked efficiently, the large unexpected issue was working with clients indirectly (and inefficiently).

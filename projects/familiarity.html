                    This little (probably won't be by the time I finish writing) excerpt formulated itself while walking around an applience showroom with my mom.

                    <br><br>

                    It is always fun to dream. Since I was able to use the internet, I found myself browsing various consumer markets for things that I rightfully could never afford. Browsing the Porsche website and speccing out the most gorgeous 911 gt3 money could buy, or looking at zillow listings for homes while I was in my mid-teens, dreaming is a core part of being human. Now how that that correlate back to appliences... 

                    <br><br>

                    Any showroom is a dangerous place to find yourself in when you're in the market for something new, especially when constrained by a budget. As both me and my mom wandered the showroom floor, looking for appliences to spec out a kitchen is our soon to be built house, the most attractive options were of course- in the most expensive showrooms. Nonetheless being able to physically touch the knobs and the surfaces of the appliences really helped in distinguishing the build quality and feel of certain appliences. As all of this was incredibly new to me, I was able to learn about the different pricing ranges and feature sets of ranges and dishwashers and fridges... Normal things to learn at 20 years old I guess??

                    After doing the rounds through the showroom floor we found ourselves in the last section of showroom that showcased all the appliences lined up to showcase differences. As we wandered around, I found myself absolutely glued to the wall of double stack ovens. After messing with the functionality of an applience- I came to an interesting realization that left me really baffled while leaving. It really showcases a shift in many industries in the world of User Interfaces and the overall User Experience of a lot of modern "smart" products. 

                    <br><br>

                    It was so interesting to see that the majority of ovens on that wall all used the same touchscreen system installed. Now, this was definitely a result of the showroom favoring a parent company with their sub-brands, but it was a very interesting to have the user interface feel the same in a top-of-the-line GE Monogram oven and a GE Profile which is almost a third of the cost. This would be a great thing if it didn't feel incredibly unresponsive and bloated.
